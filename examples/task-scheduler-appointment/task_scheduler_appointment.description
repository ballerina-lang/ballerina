// Task Scheduler can be used to schedule an Appointment. An appointment should
// have an `appointmentData` field. It can be either a `string` representing a
// cron expression or an `AppointmentData` record. Optionally a
// `noOfRecurrences` field can be used to provide the maximum number of times
// the appointment should run before shutdown.
// A service can be attached to the Scheduler using `attach()` function.
// Then the Scheduler can be started using `start()` method. When the scheduler
// needs to be cancelled, `stop()` method can be called.
