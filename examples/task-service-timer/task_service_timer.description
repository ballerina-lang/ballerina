// Task Timer Services are used to execute tasks periodically. A timer should have
// an `interval` specified, and an `initialDelay` if needed. The delay
// specifies the initial delay before the task is executed for the first time.
// Thereafter, the timer triggers at the provided interval. The `onTrigger()`
// resource is called when the timer triggers.
