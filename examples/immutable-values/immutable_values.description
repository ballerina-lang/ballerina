// Ballerina allows making values immutable, or read-only.
//
// A value of type `anydata` can be made immutable by calling the `.freeze()` built-in method on it. A successful
// freeze attempt would return the value with the frozen flag set. Calling freeze on structures would deeply
// freeze all elements.
//
// Freeze is also defined on values that may be of type `anydata` at run time (e.g., `any`, unions consisting of
// `anydata` and `non-anydata` types). If a `non-anydata` value is found, the freeze attempt would return an error.
//
// The built-in method `.isFrozen()` could be used to check if a value is frozen.
//
// Attempts to modify a frozen value would cause panic.
