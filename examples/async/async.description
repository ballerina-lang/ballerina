// Async functionality in Ballerina is a way to execute operations in an asynchronous manner by returning a `future`.
// The `future` can be used to extract the result of the async function call (if available), check the running status of an execution,
// or cancel the operation if needed. You can wait for a single async function or multiple async functions to complete using the `wait` expression.
