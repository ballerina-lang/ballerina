// A secured client with OAuth2 authentication is used to connect to a
// secured service with OAuth2 authentication. An additional `auth`
// field is added to the HTTP client endpoint initialization in order
// to make the simple HTTP client endpoint into a secure client endpoint.
// Within the `auth` field, the `scheme` is defined as `http:OAUTH2` and
// `config` is defined accordingly based on the OAuth2 authentication. Within
// the `config` field, the `grantType` is defined as `http:CLIENT_CREDENTIALS_GRANT`,
// `http:PASSWORD_GRANT`, or `http:DIRECT_TOKEN`. Also, the `config` field
// is defined with relevant grant type configurations.
