// Ballerina provides first class support for streams. This is powered by the Siddhi Complex Event Processing (CEP)
// engine. You can build streaming queries using the user friendly syntax. The queries include projection, filtering,
// windows, stream joins, and patterns.
// Ballerina Streams is an experimental feature. Please use `--experimental` flag when compiling Ballerina files
// which have streaming constructs.
