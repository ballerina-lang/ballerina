// In Ballerina, panic means something unexpected has occured
// (something that should not have occurred during the normal operation). A panic causes
// the call stack to be unwound until a matching catcher is found.

// Ballerina encourages developers NOT to use `panic` for handling program related
// errors such as `header not found`, `data mismatched` errors, etc.). However, 
// `Connection Closed/Timeout` and `OutOfMemory` errors can be used in an error situation 
// where it could not handle the error by itself, such as when accessing a `Null` reference.
