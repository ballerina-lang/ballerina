// XML elements may have any number of attributes and any number
// of namespace declarations that apply for that element. 
// In Ballerina, both of these types are treated the same. 
// Attributes are accessed from an XML sequence using the `@` postfix operator.
// XML attribute access is at the experimental stage,
// Thus, use the --experimental flag to enable them.
