// A secured client with JWT authentication is used to connect to a
// secured service with JWT authentication. An additional `auth`
// field is added to the HTTP client endpoint initialization in order
// to make the simple HTTP client endpoint into a secure client endpoint.
// Inside the `auth` field the `scheme` is defined for JWT authentication.
