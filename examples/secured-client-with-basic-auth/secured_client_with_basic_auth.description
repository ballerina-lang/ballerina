// A secured client with basic authentication is used to connect to a
// secured service with basic authentication. An additional `auth`
// field is added to the HTTP client endpoint initialization in order
// to make the simple HTTP client endpoint into a secure client endpoint.
// Inside the `auth` field the `scheme`, `username` and `password`
// is defined for basic authentication.
