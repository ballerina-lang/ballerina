// One of the design principles of the type system of Ballerina is to eliminate null reference errors.
// Over the years, null reference errors have caused numerous system crashes, security vulnerabilities etc.
// Optional types in Ballerina are union types that allow developers to identify the value or the function
// of the type `T`. Optionally, this can be done for any `T`. You can syntactically represent this as `T?` or T|()`.
