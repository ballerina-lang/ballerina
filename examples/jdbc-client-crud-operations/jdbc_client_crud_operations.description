// This example demonstrates how to execute data definition statements, insert/update/delete data
// and select data using JDBC Client. For MYSQL and H2 you could use corresponding MYSQL and
// H2 clients implemented specifically for each of them.
// This sample uses MySQL DB. Before running the sample, copy the
// MySQL JDBC driver to the `BALLERINA_HOME/bre/lib` folder and change the DB connection
// properties as required.
