// The `.clone()` built-in method is used to make a copy of an `anydata` value.
// `anydata` is equivalent to `()|boolean|int|float|decimal|string|(anydata|error)[]|map<anydata|error>|xml|table`.
// Clone is defined on all structured types but returns an error if the value is not `anydata`.
// The resultant copy is a deep copy.
// A deep copy copies all fields, and makes copies of dynamically allocated memory pointed to by the fields.
// It preserves cycles, storage type, and immutability.
