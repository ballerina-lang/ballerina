# What is Ballerina?

Ballerina is the premier programming language designed for integration. It allows you to connect apps and services to handle all types of integration scenarios, such as collecting top tweets from a specific location and adding them to a Google spreadsheet, generating emails with real-time quotes pulled from a stock quote service, transforming and routing data based on advanced logic, and much more. 

Ballerina is:

* **Flexible**. You can use the visual editor to build your integration from sequence diagrams, or write code directly into the source editor. You can also use the IDEA plug-in to write your Ballerina code in IntelliJ IDEA. Ballerina is open source, so you can see exactly how it works and join the growing community of users contributing to its code base.

* **Powerful**. The Ballerina language was designed from the ground up specifically for integration and can handle everything from a simple Hello World program to complex service chaining and content-based routing scenarios. The runtime is lightweight and incredibly fast. And it includes an API that allows you to incorporate its functionality in other applications.

* **Beautiful**. Ballerina's visual editor allows you to easily visualize your integration scenario and all the components that need to interact by dragging and dropping elements onto a canvas. As you create the diagram, the integration code is written for you, and at any time you can switch to the Source view to see and modify the code.
