Welcome to the Ballerina documentation!
=======================================
Ballerina is the premier programming language designed for integration. It includes a visual editor that allows you to easily model and create your integrations by creating sequence diagrams. The source editor allows you to access and edit the underlying Ballerina code that's generated from the diagrams. 

This documentation will help you get up and running fast and provides a full language reference for writing Ballerina programs.
