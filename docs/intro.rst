==================
What is Ballerina?
==================
Ballerina is the premier programming language designed for integration. It allows you to connect apps and services to handle all types of integration scenarios, such as collecting top tweets from a specific location and adding them to a Google spreadsheet, generating emails with real-time quotes pulled from a stock quote service, transforming and routing data based on advanced logic, and much more. 

Ballerina includes a visual editor that allows you to create sequence diagrams to build your integrations. This allows you to easily visualize your integration scenario and all the components that need to interact. As you create the diagram, the integration code is written for you, and at any time you can switch to the Source view to see and modify the code. 

Ballerina is open source, so you can see exactly how it works and join the growing community of users contributing to its code base. It includes an API that allows you to incorporate its functionality in your own code.
