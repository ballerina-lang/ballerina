// Workers within a fork-join can access the variables that are declared within the scope of that statement.
// The variables can be value type variables or reference type variables.
// Value type variables, such as string, integer, float, and blob type variables, are passed into the workers as a copy
// of the original data. Therefore, you are able to update the value of it within the worker and that value is only
// defined within the specific worker.
// Reference type variables, such as map, json, xml, and records type variables, are passed into these workers as a
// reference to the original data. Therefore, if you update the value of these variables within a worker, the value gets
// updated for the entire function.
// The Join block receives a map of any type array, which contains the data sent from the respective workers.
