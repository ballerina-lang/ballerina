NAME
    Ballerina test - Run Ballerina tests and display a summary of 
    test results.

SYNOPSIS
    ballerina test [-lg|--list-groups] [--groups <test_group, ...>] 
        [--disable-groups <test_group, ...>] [--sourceroot <path>]
        [-e] [--debug <port>] [-c <config_file>]
        [--exclude-modules <modules, ...>]
        [--config <config_file>] [-B] [<balfile>|<module-name>]


DESCRIPTION
    The `ballerina test` command allows you to compile and run Ballerina 
    test sources and prints a summary of test results. You can 
    execute tests in a standalone test file, a test module, or an
    entire Ballerina project.
    
    Use `ballerina test` without any parameters to execute tests for 
    the entire project.
    
    Use `ballerina test <module-name>` to execute tests within the
    specified module.
    
    Use `ballerina test <balfile>` to execute the given Ballerina test 
    file. Note that imports from other modules will not work for
    file executions. File path can be a relative or absolute.

OPTIONS

     -lg
     --list-groups
         List the test groups available in the test files. Groups are 
         tags that are added to test functions. The groups are used to
         control the execution of test functions by specifying a  
         group or a set of groups that need to be executed in a test 
         run. A test function can be grouped with the groups parameter 
         within the @test:config annotation.

     --groups <test_group, ...>              
         Specify test groups to be executed. Groups are tags that are 
         added to test functions. The groups are used to control the 
         execution of test functions by specifying a group or a set of 
         groups that need to be executed in a test run. A test 
         function can be grouped with the groups parameter within the
         @test:config annotation.

     --disable-groups <test_group, ...>      
         Specify test groups to be excluded. Groups are tags that are 
         added to test functions. The groups are used to control the 
         execution of test functions by specifying a group or a set of 
         groups that need to be executed in a test run. A test 
         function can be grouped with the groups parameter within the
         @test:config annotation.

     --sourceroot <path>         
         Location of the remote project root with the source files. All 
         executions will be relative to the path provided as the 
         `sourceroot`. 

     -e <key=value>
         Set Ballerina environment parameters as key/value pairs.
         If multiple parameters need to be provided, each parameter
         has to be specified using its own -e flag. For details of the
         environment parameters that the Ballerina standard library
         modules support, refer the relevant API
         documentation.

     --debug <port>               
         Remote debug Ballerina tests with respect to the given port.   

     --exclude-modules <modules, ...>
         Specify the modules to be excluded.

     -c <config_file>
     --config <config_file>
         Provide the path to a Ballerina configuration file.
         The configuration file format is a subset of the TOML file
         format. It supports key/value pairs, tables, comments, and
         string, int, float and boolean value types.

     -B <key=value>
         Provide Ballerina VM options to be used by the runtime
         when executing a Ballerina program or module. VM options
         are key/value pairs. If multiple VM options need to be
         provided, each option has to be specified using its
         own -B flag.

EXAMPLES
     Run all tests in the current project:
     $ ballerina test

     Run all tests in the `hello_service_test.bal` file:  
     $ ballerina test hello_service_test.bal 

     Run tests in the `math` module:
     $ ballerina test math

     List all test groups in all Ballerina source files in 
     tests: 
     $ ballerina test -lg tests 

     Run only the set of tests belonging to `group_x` in all Ballerina 
     source files in tests: 
     $ ballerina test --groups group_x  tests
