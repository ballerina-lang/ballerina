## Module Overview

This module provides an LDAP authentication provider, which can be used to authenticate using LDAP credentials.

The `auth:LdapAuthStoreProvider` is another implementation of the `auth:AuthProvider` interface. This connects to an active directory or an LDAP, retrieves the necessary user information, and performs authentication and authorization.
